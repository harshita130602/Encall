## Introduction
**ENCALL** is a Peer-to-Peer Communication platform developed by **Harshita Upadhyay** using Reactjs, Nodejs along with SOCKET.IO and WebRTC. It is a suitable application for web as well as mobile to use for Interviews as it offers Video/Audio Conferencing along with notes and whiteboard facility.
Hosted on - https://encall.netlify.app/

## Technologies used

* **ReactJS** 
Reatjs has been used for the **Front-end** as it is used for building user interfaces and for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps, which is what needed. **Encall is a web as well as mobile application.**

* **NodeJS**
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. So, here it is used for **Back-end**.

* **WebRTC**
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a free and open-source project providing web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs). It allows audio and video communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need to install plugins or download native apps. So, here it is used for **peer-to-peer video communication**.
* **SOCKET. IO**
Socket. IO enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed. So, here it is used for **Video-communication as well as live text-editor** feature.

## Agile Methodology Used
The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases, popularly known as sprints. So, the whole development of the project was divided into four different sprints :- 
*  **Design** - The Design Sprint is a fast-paced, agile approach to product design. Essentially, it was a week long process which was used to develop and test new ideas using a series of highly-effective Design Thinking exercises. All of the features of the application were decided along with the design of the front-end of the application. 
    ***Note*** - Front-end was finalised using Adobe Illustrator.

* **Build** - The focus of the Build phase,which was a week long, was to develop the system to the point where it is ready for pre-production testing. In previous phases, the majority of the requirements have been identified and the architecture for the system has been baselined. So, In this sprint, the whole backend along with frontend was coded for the following features:- 
    * Video/Audio Meeting
    * Turn on/off the Audio/Video
    * Downloadable Notes   


* **Adapt** - In the adapt phase of five days, the peer-to-peer '*chat feature*' was adapted as per the requirement. Along with it, the feature of '*notification for chat*' was also added to the project. 

* **Testing & Delivery** -  In a week long phase of testing and delivery, all of the features were tested for 3 days and some of the features were refined, the refinement and deployment of the application took 2 days. After the completion of the application, two days were given to technical document along with the demo video.
